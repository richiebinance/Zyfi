# Benefits of using Zyfi for a Dapp

Zyfiâ€™s interface aims for simplicity when it comes to dApp integration and only requires a single API call to use. As a developer you maintain full control and are provided the flexibility to adopt any desired model without the need for changes to the smart contract. Some of the many benefits of using Zyfi include:

* The user knows the fee amount when signing, and is allowing the paymaster only that
* Any gas that isn't spent is refunded to the user in the fee token itself
* The smart contracts are audited, immutable and verified

In future, Zyfi are releasing a new paymaster and endpoint that allows the custom sponsorhip whereby protocols can use off-chain logic to decide to sponsor part or all of each transaction.
