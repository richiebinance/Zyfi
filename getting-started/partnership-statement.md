# Partnership Statement

Zyfi is integrated by many dApps in the ecosystem, e.g. ZeroLend (Supply & Borrow), Gravita (CDP), Increment Fi (Perp) and zkMarkets ( NFT marketplace) - with more in the pipeline.

Zyfi has also partnered with major NFT collections on zkSync, offering a gasless experience and utility for their holders. On top of the paymaster service, Zyfi offers a gasless portal to the ecosystem, where users can experience the power of native AA: they can swap at the best rates, send tokens without having ETH, or submit custom paymaster transaction to interact with protocols that don't offer a paymaster solution yet.
