# Introduction to Zyfi

What is [Zyfi](https://www.zyfi.org/) ?

[Zyfi](https://www.zyfi.org/) is a Paymaster-as-a-Service that focuses on flexibility and ease of integration. It was created as a way to accelerate the adoption of paymasters in the zkSync ecosystem. DApps can either propose to their users to pay with any ERC-20 traded on zkSync (currently more than 80), or decide to sponsor part or all of the transaction gas cost with their own custom logic.
